# Project Portfolio Website: A Million Stories in One City
“A Million Stories in One City” shares stories of each city through sounds. We use it to showcase your works (sonic narratives) and our journey in an attempt to travel to different cities in China. Besides, it is also a bridge that connects our stories closer to people and engages them in travel and cultural storytelling through sounds.
